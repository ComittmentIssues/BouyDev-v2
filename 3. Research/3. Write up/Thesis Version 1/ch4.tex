\label{ch:ch4}

In this chapter, the hardware design processes are outlined based on the user requirements and technical specifications given in Chapter \ref{ch:ch3}. This chapter begins with a description of the mechanical features showing how the design accommodates the electronic subsystems while meeting the functional requirements outlined in Table \ref{tab:hard_funcreqsl}. This chapter then shows the electronic components selected for each subsystem and how they affect the overall system. Finally, this chapter will conclude with the final design considerations for the buoy. \par 

Son and Vorajee in 2018 performed initial concept work for the buoy, which strongly influenced the current design choices for this device. Furthermore, MacHutchon designed the original buoy stand with modifications by Verrinder to accommodate the buoy. Verrinder designed the physical enclosure and electronic hardware subsystems for the first (V1) and second (V2) versions of the buoy with further design contributions from Jacobson (V1, V2), Cloete (V1) and Pead (V2).
\section{Mechanical features}

The mechanical design for the system falls outside the scope of this project. However, it forms an integral part in protecting the electronics against sea ice dynamics, strong wave activity and freezing. This subsystem consists of two parts: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Buoy stand
	\item Enclosure
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Buoy stand}

The principle goal of the stand is to anchor the device to the ice floe and protect it from the harsh environment. A buoy stand was designed by K. MacHutchon with modification from R. Verrinder and was constructed by the University of Cape Town's Mechanical Engineering Workshop to satisfy this requirement. The stand is shown in Figure \ref{fig:stand} and is 1.2 m tall with a width of 0.71 m. The stand has a cylindrical cradle at the top where the device will be placed. A screw hole in the side of the cradle allows the buoy to be fastened to the stand to prevent it from falling out during deployment. The base of the stand is pyramid shaped with metal spikes to anchor the system to an ice floe. Due to the height of the stand, the system may be susceptible to tipping. This has been overcome by constructing the base to be heavier than the top thereby lowering the centre of gravity. The stand was originally designed for the Trident buoys. However, this design has been modified by increasing the radius of the housing.

	\caption{Diagram of the buoy stand for the SHARC buoy. The stand consists of stainless steel and painted mild steel to withstand the climate of the Southern Ocean and stop the stand from rusting. A cradle at the top of the stand houses the buoy and secures it to the stand via a screw. The buoy stand elevates the electronics 1 m above the ice to overcome the effects of snow growth and flooding. Finally, spikes at the bottom of the base will secure the stand to the ice floe. Drawn by R. Verrinder.}
	\label{fig:stand}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enclosure}

The second part of the mechanical subsystem is the physical buoy enclosure, which was designed by R. Verrinder. The greatest challenge for designing this system was selecting a material that was both lightweight and low-temperature resistant. A decision was made to use High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) which can survive temperatures up to $-120 ^\circ$ C before becoming too brittle \cite{drnovska2003surface}. The enclosure was designed to fit the housing on the buoy stand while providing ample room for the antennas of the various communication modules. It was split into three parts: A top enclosure, a bottom enclosure and a connector block. A schematic of the enclosure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:enclo_schem}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{enclo_schem.PNG}
	\caption{2-D exploded view of the buoy enclosure showing (A) the bottom enclosure for the power module, (B) the connector block which also acts as a base for the electronics and (C) the top enclosure which covers the electronics. Drawn by R. Verrinder.}

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[H]

		&  O-ring thickness & 2.6 \\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	
	\label{tab:enc_meas}
\end{table}

This design allows for easy access to the electronics as well as separation between the various subsystems. The connector block acts as a connection point for the electronics in version 1 of the buoy. This point of contact was a three-dimensional printed connector for a vertically mounted printed circuit board (PCB). In version 2 of the buoy, this was replaced by a row of screw holes around the connector block to connect a horizontal stack of customised PCBs. This was found to greatly improve the robustness of the system and prevented components from breaking during transport and deployment. The communication modules, microcontroller and sensors were mounted in the top enclosure while the batteries and power system were placed in the bottom enclosure. The power system was connected to the top enclosure through a drill hole in the connector block. The system was waterproofed by placing two o-rings on either side of the connector block. The top and bottom enclosure are fastened to the connector block using a a flat head counter-sunk hex screw. Finally a drill hole in the connector block allowed the system to be secured to the buoy stand preventing it from falling out during deployment.

\section{Electronics}

The electronics for the system refer to the communication subsystems, power electronics, sensors and processors. Due to project time constraints, the approach to developing the platform was to select off-the-shelf components that satisfied the subsystem specifications shown in Table \ref{tab:sys_specs}. Further consideration was given to components that were low power (SP011, SP012) and cost effective (SP013). Additionally, devices with intelligent operations were selected as this would allow us to effectively control the current consumption and operations of the device. These consisted of components with programmable settings such as digital sensors and modems. The following section gives an overview of the selection consideration for each subsystem.

\subsection{GPS}
\label{subsec:ch3_gps}
A u-blox NEO-7M\footcite{UBLOX_M7N_DATA} GPS receiver was initially selected during the 2018 design concept phase as it was easy to procure and has a small form factor. The positioning  module was designed around a Waveshare\footcite{waveshare} development board which significantly decreases the development time. The board comes with an active patch antenna which has a gain of about 30 dB \cite{waveshare}. In addition, the component is low power with a relatively fast acquisition time and accuracy. The device also can be configured to output diagnostic information such as dilution of procession with the associated measurement which can provide a greater understanding of satellite connectivity in the region. However,  this product has been depreciated by the time the latest buoy was developed. To overcome this, we opted for the u-blox NEO-M9N\footcite{UBLOX_M9N_DATA} module which had improved performance at a higher cost. Both GPS modules are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gps_mod}.

 Shows the u-blox NEO-M9N offers improved performance  over the u-blox NEO-7M at a higher cost and higher power consumption. This module comes on a Sparkfun GPS Breakout\footnote{Available at: \url{https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gps-neo-m9n-hookup-guide}} - NEO-M9N U.FL (Qwiic) board which optionally comes with an integrated chip antenna. The chip antenna however has a very small gain making it unsuitable to be used for this application. Therefore, an additional antenna was bought. 

\subsection{Iridium}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:sec3_UR}, the Iridium modem is critical for ensuring data can be transmitted from remote locations where other forms of communication are unavailable. When selecting a modem, key considerations were given to the physical size, bandwidth as well as coverage. In addition, we require a module that is low powered and cost effective. For this reason, we have selected the Rock7 RockBLOCK 9603\cite{rockblock2019image} which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rockblock} below.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.3\textwidth]{rockblock9603.jpg}
	\caption{A Rock7 RockBLOCK 9603 satellite module containing an Iridium 9603 modem \cite{9603} and a coaxial Sub-miniature version A (SMA) connector for an external antenna. Image by \textcite{rockblock2019image}.}
	\label{fig:rockblock}
\end{figure}

This module contains an Iridium 9603 modem on a specially designed power board. The device communicates via Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) with the option for flow control. Communication is performed through a ten-pin Molex PicoBlade connector. The module contains four communications pins, one digital input pin and two digital output pins. Power is supplied either through a 5 V pin or 3.3V pin in addition to the ground pin. A brief description of the pinout is given in Table \ref{tab:ir_pinout}.

	\label{tab:ir_pinout}
\end{table}

The device communicates via UART through the RXD and TXD pins. Additional flow control pins Clear To Send (CTS) and Request To Send (RTS) pins are available in the interface. However, these are optional. The OnOff pin can be used to put the device to sleep which significantly improves power performance. Finally, the NetAv and Ring Indicator are digital output pins that can be used to indicate whether there is sufficient signal to transmit as well as to notify when a message is waiting to be downloaded respectively.  Finally, the key characteristics for the device are shown in Table \ref{tab:ir_specsmech} to \ref{tab:ir_specscomm}.

\subsection{Environmental sensors}

Two versions of the buoy were developed from 2019 to 2020 with different sensing capabilities. The first version consisted of a Maxim Integrated DS18B20 temperature sensor \cite{DS18B20manual}. This is a low cost digital silicon temperature sensor with a small form factor that uses one-wire interface. However, in version two, this device was replaced with the Bosch Sensortech BMP280 sensor \cite{BMP280_Datasheet}. The BMP280 sensor featured pressure sensing as well as temperature sensing as well as a programmable interface. Furthermore, the BMP280 can optionally be ordered on an Adafruit BMP breakout board \cite{BMP280breakout} whereas the DS18B20 arrives as a stand-alone through-hole component that requires an additional circuit. The devices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bmpds} while a comparison of the features of each device is given in Table \ref{tab:senv_spec}.

	\label{tab:senv_spec}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:senv_spec} shows a comparison between the Bosch Sensortech BMP280 and Maxim DS18B20 performance characteristics. The temperature ranges of both sensors are capable of measuring subzero temperatures at an accuracy of $\pm1^\circ$ C which, is required to survive in the Southern Ocean climate as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:chapter2}. Only the BMP280 can measure temperature and pressure, whereas the DS18B20 can only measure temperature. Furthermore, the BMP280 cost R47.00 cheaper than the DS18B20 at R77.00. However, this is for the standalone BMP280. This device can be, optionally,  ordered on an Adafruit breakout board. However, this increases the price to R218\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.digikey.co.za/short/qbn473mr}}. Therefore, the BMP280 was selected for version 2 as it contains more environmental sensing features for a lower price. The power consumption characteristics of each device are shown in Table \ref{tab:env_power}.

\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
		\hline

	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:env_power}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:env_power} shows the power performance characteristics of the BMP280 and the DS18B20. The DS18B20 has a lower operating voltage requirement with a smaller sleep current draw than the BMP280. However, the DS18B20 has a much higher active current. Furthermore, both devices can operate at 3.3 V. Therefore, the BMP280 will have the lowest active power consumption during operation. \par 

In conclusion, the BMP280 offers both temperature and pressure sensing at a lower price than the DS18B20 that can only perform temperature measurements. Therefore the BMP280 was selected for version 2 of the buoy to increase environmental sensing capabilities.

\subsection{Power monitoring sensors}

Finally, a digital sensor for power monitoring was selected to provide constant feedback on the status of the power system. This device is used to monitor the battery voltage and current to keep track of the buoys power consumption. To achieve this, the Texas Instruments INA219A I$^\text{2}$C power monitor \cite{INA219} was selected. This device has a high reported accuracy of 1\% over a full temperature range and is fully programmable. The device  communicates via I$^2$C with 16-bit registers storing values for  current (mA), voltage (V) and power (mW). The device is extremely low power with a high voltage measurement range and on-board calibration features. The integrated circuit (IC) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ina} while the key performance characteristics are shown in Table \ref{tab:INA_spec}.

Table \ref{tab:INA_spec} above shows that the device is capable of measuring voltage, current and power at low temperatures up to -40$\degree$ C thereby making it a suitable choice for active power monitoring of the device in the polar climate.

\subsection{Inertial measurement unit}

The TDK InvenSense MPU6050\cite{mpu6050} is a 6-axis inertial measurement unit IMU that measures the acceleration and rotational velocity of 3 axes respectively. This component has a small form factor, low power and is fully programmable allowing the device to operate in different modes thereby optimising the data flow to and from the device. While the device does not contain a magnetometer, this is not an issue since the region suffers greatly from magnetic distortion \cite{kohout2015device} thereby rendering all magnetic readings to be unreliable. In addition, the acceleration of waves can be defined by Stoke's upper limit as 0.5 g for a non breaking wave  \cite{kohout2015device}. The device has a programmable full scale range for both the accelerometer and gyroscope. It contains an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter and on-board self testing for added robustness and data integrity thereby making it  the ideal device for this application. The device can be, optionally, ordered on a SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro Breakout - MPU-6050 which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mpubreakout}. The key parameters for the device are shown in Table \ref{tab:mpu_specscc} to \ref{tab:mpu_specs}.

Table \ref{tab:mpu_specs} shows that the TDK InvenSense MPU6050 IMU has the capabilities to measure acceleration and angular velocity necessary to perform wave calculations as described in Chapter \ref{subsec:ch2_wavemeas}. The device can operate with a voltage supply of 2.4 V to 3.5 V. Furthermore, the lowest sample rate of the IMU is 4 Hz which is well above the Nyquist sampling criteria for open ocean waves as discussed by \textcite{earle1996nondirectional} in Subsection \ref{subsec:ch2_wavemeas}. This device is also capable of operating in low temperatures up to -40$\degree$ C which, is suitable for the Southern Ocean climate. The chip can, optionally, arrive on a  SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro Breakout - MPU-6050. However, this board has an increased cost of R437\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.digikey.co.za/short/bpqqdjdv}} compared to R110 for a standalone chip. For this reason, the Sparkfun board was used to develop and test the firmware for the device. Verrinder and Pead designed the circuit for the MPU6050 for the final version of the buoy.

\subsection{Memory}
\label{subsec:ch3_mem}
Physical memory is an important feature in the device as it allows for permanent storage of data during the life cycle of buoy. Having the device in various sleep modes may result in lost data if the data are stored in non-volatile memory.

Flash chips were selected as a permanent solution. A total of four Adesto Technologies AT45DB641E SPI serial flash chips \cite{AT45DB641E} were selected and mounted on a PCB directly interfacing with the system. Each chip can hold up to 64 megabits of data. Data can be read/written at speeds of up to 85 MHz of 15 MHz in low power mode. These chips are low power with high data retention requiring a supply voltage of 1.7 V to 3.6 V and draws a maximum of 11 mA in active read mode thereby making it one of the lowest power consumption components in the system. In addition, the device comes with two 256 byte buffers that can store data while a read/write operation is taking place. Memory is Organised into sectors (2 to 256 KB long), blocks (2 KB long) and pages (256 bytes) with write, read and erase options at each level. The device comes in a surface mount package shown in Figure \ref{fig:flashAAHAH}. Table \ref{tab:flash_specs} shows key performance characteristics.

\subsection{Processor}

For the processor, a single processing unit was selected to reduce complexity of the system. However, to satisfy the requirements for the buoy, a processor must be selected with sufficient peripheral ports to handle communication from all sensors, communication modules and memory banks. In addition, there should be sufficient digital input and output pins to control the sensors and provide feedback. The communication peripheral requirements are condensed into Table \ref{tab:micro_ports}: 

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{ Type and number of communication ports to facilitate communication among all the external modules.}
	\setlength{\extrarowheight}{5pt}
	\begin{tabular}{lc}
		\hline 
		\textbf{Peripheral name} & \textbf{Qty }\\

		SPI & 2\\
		\hline
		Digital pins & 11\\
		\hline 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:micro_ports}
\end{table}

From Subsections \ref{subsec:ch3_gps} to \ref{subsec:ch3_mem}, the modules given have a data requirement and a communication requirement. Some modules, such as the RockBLOCK 9603 modem, require additional digital pins. Furthermore, all sensors output data at different resolutions. The BMP280 and MPU6050 have an 8-bit resolution, while the INA219 has a 16-bit resolution. Therefore, the selected processor needs to have sufficient width to accommodate incoming data of varying sizes while containing sufficient peripherals to interface with and control the subsystems. For this reason, a 32-bit microcontroller was selected for the processing system. During the prototyping period, three processors were selected from the STMicroelectronics STM32 range of microcontrollers for different versions of the buoy. These microcontrollers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mcus}.

(B) is the 64-pin STMicroelectronics Nucleo development board which initially contained an STMicroelectronics STM32F446RE \cite{stm32nucleo} for version 2. However, it was replaced with an STMicroelectronics STM32L476RG \cite{stm32l4} for the final version.}
	\label{fig:mcus}
\end{figure}

The first version of the buoy contained the STMicroelectronics STM32F407VGT6 \cite{stmdisc} which is available on a 100-pin Discovery development board. However, this device was found to have more peripherals than necessary and had a large power requirement. Therefore the device was replaced by the STMicroelectronics STM32F446RE \cite{stm32nucleo}. This device came on the STMicroelectronics Nucleo development board and had reduced peripherals and more optimal performance. The final processor selected was the STMicroelectronics STM32L476RG \cite{stm32l4}. Development boards were selected for the prototyping phase as they were quick to set up and program. In Figure \ref{fig:mcus}, both the Discovery and the Nucleo have pin headers allowing for quick interfacing with the peripherals of the microcontroller. Which matched the STM32F446RE in pinout and number of peripherals. However, it was more optimised for low power operation. This microcontroller had additional wake-up pins and lower current consumption. Furthermore, the Nucleo boards have an on-board STLink debugger to program the microcontroller. However, this can be removed to reduce the physical size of the module. The STM32L476RG can be configured to detect brownout events and low power events. This provides critical feedback regarding the device's performance. Some key performance parameters of the STM32L476RE are shown in Table \ref{tab:stm_specelec} to \ref{tab:stm_speccom} .

Tables \ref{tab:stm_specelec} to \ref{tab:stm_speccom} show the performance characteristics of the STM32L476RG. It features seven general purpose timers as well as two advanced timers and two low power timers. In addition, the device has five wake up pins which allow the device to be woken up from deep sleep (shutdown) via an external source. The device is capable of  digital signal processing (DSP) using external libraries provided by the manufacturer. This allows the device to perform wave spectra calculations as described by \textcite{kuik1988method} and \textcite{earle1996nondirectional}. Furthermore, the STM32L4 Nucleo board contains an onboard real-time clock (RTC) with a 32.768 kHz LSE crystal to provide an accurate reference for time-based applications thereby making it the ideal component to be a processor for the buoy.

\subsection{Power electronics}

Based on the aforementioned hardware selection, the following power requirements are outlined in Table\ref{tab:pow_budget}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Current consumption of various components as well as the estimated maximum possible current draw.}

		\cline{4-4}
		\cline{4-4}
	\end{tabular}
	
	\label{tab:pow_budget}
\end{table}

From Table \ref{tab:pow_budget}, a maximum current draw of 587.50 mA can be expected if all the sensors are running concurrently. The largest consumer of power is the RockBLOCK 9603 which can draw up to 450 mA when charging. Therefore, the power supply needs to be to supply at least 500 mA during startup. Current can be conserved by placing the devices into sleep mode which further reduces the current consumption from the batteries. These techniques will be discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:ch5}. Finally, by only turning the components on when required, more power can be conserved. \par 

Therefore, a regulator is required to supply the required current at a constant voltage while being able to stand the drastic changes in current consumption. A decision was made to use a 5 V low dropout regulator (LDO) to supply the 5 V components directly. The 3.3 V components are powered through the STMicroelectronics Nucleo-L476RG on-board 3.3 V regulator. The 5 V LDO is a Texas Instruments LP3876 7 V LDO \cite{LP3876} which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lp3876}.

	\label{fig:lp3876}
\end{figure}

This regulator is capable of supplying up to 3 A. The device has a quick response to step changes and an adjustable output voltage thereby making it the ideal device to supply power.$10$ $\mu$C tantalum capacitors are used as decoupling capacitors to filter the power source as these capacitors have excellent robustness and transient responses especially at low temperatures. Some key characteristics for the device are given in Table \ref{tab:lp_spec}.

The LDO was placed on a customised PCB designed by Verrinder with the Texas Instruments INA219A current sensor as well as an indicator LED to show that the batteries have sufficient charge. The power board was supplied by 3.6 V C-cell LiSOCl$_2$ batteries. These batteries have ideal low temperature characteristics as well as a high capacity. Two cells were placed in series to create a 7.2 V power source which was placed in parallel with another 7.2 V array to increase the capacity. The batteries, battery holders and power board are connected to form a single subsystem which was placed in the bottom enclosure and connected to the microcontroller via a 7-pin cable.

Customised PCBs were designed to connect the various subsystems together. The device was kept modular by separating PCBs and grouping devices by functionality. A circuit board was created for the LP3876 LDO and INA219 current sensor which was affixed to four C-cell battery holders.The battery holders have leads which were were arranged in a 2-series, 2-parallel configuration.

	\caption{Power module for the SHARC BUOY. A custom PCB with a low dropout regulator and current sensor connected to a battery pack.}
	\label{fig:bot_elec}
\end{figure}

This module was placed in the bottom enclosure and fastened to the connector block using a hex screw. A customised 7-pin Molex DuraClik cable connects the module to the modules in the top enclosure. A main connector board was developed with Molex DuraClik connections for each of the aforementioned devices. The board contains two 2x16 female header rows to fit the morpho connectors of the Nucleo-L476RG development board. Two more disc-shaped PCBs were developed with the first for a communication board containing a 4-pin female header to connect the u-blox NEO GPS module and two brackets to mount the RockBLOCK 9603 Iridium module vertically. A helical antenna connects to an SMA antenna on the Iridium module. The second board was developed as a sensor board for the IMU and environmental sensor. The boards were connected in a stack configuration and fastened to the connector block using M6 metal hex spaces with the communication board being placed at the top for direct line of sight with satellites. The environmental board was secured to the base of the connector block with the BMP280 placed face-down over a hole drilled through the connector block allowing it to interface with the environment. Figure \ref{fig:top_elec} shows the configuration of the PCBs in the top enclosure of the buoy.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

This configuration greatly increases the robustness of the electronics and can overcome breaking caused by poor handling or improper deployment.  The top enclosure is placed over the electronics and fastened to the connector block using hex screws. Finally, the system is placed in the stand housing and secured using another hex screw. Final assembly of the buoy can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sharc_final}.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this chapter outlined the construction of the SHARC buoy remote sensing device. Electronic components were selected and arranged into a system and connected together on customised PCB. This platform was then used to develop the firmware which will be discussed in the next chapter.
