 \n\nWhat type of visa are you interested in?: Other\n\nPlease provide us w
 ith further details of the visa issue you wish to discuss.: I am from Sout

 tion to finally visit her and hopefully begin the process of immegration. 
 I applied in September for a subclass 476 visa  as I qualified as an engin
 eer in April 2019. I am also trying to get exemption under critical skills
  (software engineering) however\, as of today I have received no updates a
 nd am uncertain about the state of my visa application. Also the critical 
 skills exemption requires a letter of employment and without the visa\, I 
 am unable to apply for jobs.\n\nI  would like to know if there's anything 
 you can do to help and you help and how much do you charge for consultatio
 n?\n\nHow likely are you to use a Migration Agent or Immigration Lawyer to
